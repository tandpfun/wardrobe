## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tandpfun/wardrobe.git
cd wardrobe
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

⚠️ The importer stays disabled until you add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` and place a PNG reference photo of yourself at `data/model-reference.png`.

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Try it without an API key

Want to explore the gallery, outfit builder, and Outfits view before wiring up OpenAI? Seed a small local demo wardrobe and outfit collection:

```bash
npm run seed:demo   # add --force to overwrite existing demo data
npm run dev
```

The demo garments and outfit previews are drawn locally with `sharp` — no API key or reference photo required. In this unconfigured state, generating an outfit image composes a flat-lay preview from your garment cutouts instead of a modeled photo. Add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and reference photo to switch to full modeled generation.

## Outfits

Switch to the **Outfits** tab to combine pieces from your wardrobe into complete looks:

- Build an outfit by picking garments and describing the occasion and style direction.
- Generate a square modeled photo per outfit (or a local flat-lay preview in demo mode).
- Edit, regenerate, and delete outfits; everything is stored in `data/outfits.json` and `data/outfit-images/`.

Outfits created by the [`generate-outfits` Codex skill](.agents/skills/generate-outfits/SKILL.md) appear here automatically. Gallery edits (name, category, colors, tags) now persist to `data/library.json` through the app, so they survive refreshes and are shared across browsers.

## Import with Codex

This repo includes two Codex skills: one imports clothes and generates modeled item photos; the other styles complete outfits and generates a modeled lookbook.

```text
$import-clothes Import the clothes from ~/Pictures/outfits, create modeled photos, and add them to this wardrobe.
$generate-outfits Create modeled outfit ideas from my wardrobe.
```

Open the cloned repo in Codex and run either prompt. The import skill asks for a local model-reference PNG when needed, reviews every cutout and modeled photo, then writes to `data/library.json` and `data/imported/`. The outfit skill asks how many looks to create, then curates, generates, verifies, and saves the complete collection under `data/`.

### For agents

If you are setting up Wardrobe for a user, ask how they want to import their clothes:

- **Codex:** Ask for a folder or camera-roll location and a model-reference PNG, then extract, model, and import the individual pieces by following [the bundled import skill](.agents/skills/import-clothes/SKILL.md). Afterward, offer to create a requested number of modeled looks with [the outfit-generation skill](.agents/skills/generate-outfits/SKILL.md).
- **Web UI:** Help the user configure their own `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `data/model-reference.png`, then let them import through the app.

## What it does

- Detects every garment in a photo with the OpenAI Responses API
- Extracts clean product cutouts with the OpenAI Images API
- Generates an optional modeled editorial preview
- Keeps originals, jobs, generated images, and the JSON database local in `data/`
- Supports drag, drop, paste, editing, review, regeneration, and approval
